It opens doors for innovative ideas and projects that might have otherwise struggled to secure traditional funding.

   3. **Transparency and accountability in crowdfunding platforms** --->
      Blockchain provides a transparent and immutable ledger that records all transactions on the network. In the context of space mission crowdfunding, this ensures transparency and accountability. Contributors can have confidence that their funds are being utilized as intended, and project owners can showcase the progress and milestones achieved, fostering trust between funders and project creators.

## B. Tokenizing the Cosmos
   1. **Digital tokens representing space resources** --->
      Blockchain technology enables the creation of digital tokens that represent ownership or access rights to space resources. These tokens can be used to tokenize satellite data, lunar mining rights, or even fractional ownership of space artifacts. By tokenizing space resources, blockchain offers a mechanism to efficiently trade and transfer ownership, unlocking new opportunities for monetizing and leveraging space assets.

   2. **Monetizing space assets through tokenization** --->
      Tokenization of space assets enables fractional ownership and opens up new avenues for investment and fundraising. Investors can acquire tokens representing shares in a space mission or space-related project, allowing them to participate in potential revenue streams or future asset appreciation. This tokenization model provides liquidity and flexibility in space asset ownership and investment.

   3. **Expanding investment opportunities in the space industry** --->
      By tokenizing space assets, blockchain technology enables fractional ownership, reducing the barrier to entry for investors. It allows individuals to invest in space missions or space startups with smaller amounts of capital, democratizing investment opportunities in the space industry. This increased accessibility can attract a more diverse range of investors, fueling innovation and driving the growth of the space sector.

        require(_decimals > 0, "Invalid decimal value");
        require(_totalSupply > 0, "Invalid total supply");
        name = _name;
        symbol = _symbol;
        decimals = _decimals;
        totalSupply = _totalSupply;
        balanceOf[msg.sender] = _totalSupply;
    }

    function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success) {
        require(balanceOf[msg.sender] >= _value, "Insufficient balance");
        balanceOf[msg.sender] -= _value;
        balanceOf[_to] += _value;
        emit Transfer(msg.sender, _to, _value);
        return true;
    }

    function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success) {
        allowance[msg.sender][_spender] = _value;
        emit Approval(msg.sender, _spender, _value);
        return true;
    }

    function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success) {
        require(_value > 0, "Invalid transfer amount");
        require(balanceOf[_from] >= _value, "Insufficient balance");
        require(allowance[_from][msg.sender] >= _value, "Insufficient allowance");
        // Prevent transferring to the zero address
        require(_to != address(0), "Invalid recipient address");

        balanceOf[_from] -= _value;
        balanceOf[_to] += _value;
        allowance[_from][msg.sender] -= _value;
        emit Transfer(_from, _to, _value);
